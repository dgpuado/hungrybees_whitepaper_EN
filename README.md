HungryBees is an initiative which main purpose is to create a metaverse and raise awareness in society, especially among young people, about the impact of our actions on the planet. Our initiative promotes sustainability and socially responsible investment through gaming, new technologies, and the power of society.

By creating a virtual community, through a DApp (Distributed App), a "Play to Earn" model and a NFTs ecosystem, we want to have an impact and promote actions in the real world, offering the possibility to participate in a socially responsible initiative, which not only cares about the potential benefits, but also takes into account the environmental challenges and its social impact on the world.
