# ðŸ’µ Play to Earn â€“ Virtual rewards

In the HungryBees ecosystem, the rewards of the Play-to-Earn represent 63% of the tokens issued, a much higher percentage than other NFT games. The goal of these rewards is to attract a wide range of players and users to the HungryBees ecosystem, granting not only tokens but also benefits to the most active users in the community.

In this game mode, the following users' in-game behaviors and actions will be rewarded in the virtual world:

* Taking care of the hives from the inclemency of the weather
* Feeding the bees
* Win battles in Battle Mode

All generated rewards will be delivered through our in-game token (#HHON). The user will have the ability to withdraw accumulated #HHON to #HBEE, in order to trade with it in the available descentralized exchanges (DEX). It will be neecesary to wait 7 days since the last token exchange (#HHONâ‡„#HBEE) was made. The withdrawal ratio for the exchange will be 100 #HHON: 1 #HBEE. We decided it as a mechanism to reward the long-term mindset of our community members.

The HungryBees governance team will monitor the situation and may decide to vary the blockade of rewards to stabilize the value of the main token in order to avoid volatility or unwanted drops for the entire community.&#x20;

As an example, in the first two weeks, to encourage the adoption of the game, the ratio between #HBEE and #HHON will be 1:50.

#### Why is it possible to receive rewards by playing?

A game always needs players. So simply by playing, users are already adding value to the ecosystem and changing the traditional way of playing.
