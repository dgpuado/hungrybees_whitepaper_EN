# ðŸ’° Rewards model

In the HungryBees metaverse, we have two ways to reward the user involvement and to encourage them to add a constant value to the initiative. It is a combination of rewards generated both in the virtual world and in the real world through sustainable actions.&#x20;

Players' actions will have their reflection in reality. Meanwhile, the fact that our community will become wider and stronger in real life will generate a benefit within the metaverse. That is why both realities feedback into each other.
