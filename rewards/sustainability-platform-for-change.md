# ðŸŒŠ Sustainability Platform for change

In our community, members from everywhere will be able to start donations and charity campaigns, mobilizing supporters and propose HungryBees donate a percentage of its "Donation" token pool.

Each idea will be voted by the community and each month, 50,000 HBEE tokens will be released and donated to social & environmental challenges. The governance team will be responsible to make each donation real and will be in charge of adjusting the number of tokens, depending on the situation, to be something valuable for the donated.

Below you can find an example of how this platform could be:
