#### BAS (Blockchain Arbitration Society)

Due to the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency market, we have decided to join the Blockchain Arbitration Society (BAS - https://theblockchainarbitration.com). BAS is a private law association, legally constituted and formed by members of the legal, technological, and crypto community, in order to resolve internal conflicts within the crypto world. In other words, a legal environment that respects, promotes, and resolves crypto issues from the inside. By belonging to this association, we provide extra security to the community in a legal and secure framework, through a specialized Arbitration Court, which has already resolved other conflicts in the field of crypto investment.
