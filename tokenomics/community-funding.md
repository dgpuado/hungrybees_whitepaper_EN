# ðŸŒ± Community funding

In order to accelerate the development of the game and the community, we decided to launch a community support campaign, allowing exclusive access to both tokens and the main assets of the game. A total of 3.000 participants will be enabled to participate granting them exclusive and priority access to three different packages when they make a donation.

#### 0.3 BNB (800 slots)

**How will we do it?**

We will make available our initiativeÂ´s wallet for the community to receive funds and donations. Moreover, we will request information such as the email, your walletÂ´s identifier, and your Discord nickname. With these simple details, we will have the necessary information to follow up and be able to release the benefits at each of the levels.

Additionally, we will enable a system to check the status of your donation and check everything has been done correctly.
