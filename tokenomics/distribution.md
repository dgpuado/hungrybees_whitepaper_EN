# üåê Distribution

In this section, we explain how the tokens will be distributed among the community to dynamize the token economy, achieving the best possible distribution of the tokens (decentralizing) and fostering a sustainable initiative over time.

In the following table, we describe the different items in which we categorize the tokens to be issued, the percentage of tokens in each category, and the period of consolidation:

To drive the token's value stability, the following mechanisms will be implemented:

### Liquidity

Periodically, tokens will be sent to Pancakeswap's LP (Liquidity pool) to maintain price stability. The same amount of tokens burned when users buy assets (NFT) will be sent to the LP.

### Burn

The tokens that users use to buy assets in the system (NFTs) will be sent to a wallet (0x0000) for burning. This will cause deflation, as there will be fewer and fewer tokens in the system and thus potentially increase their scarcity and value.

### Total Supply

A maximum of 320 million tokens will be created. Therefore, due to their scarcity, the value of the token is expected to raise in line with the market demand.

### Team & Advisors

Team's tokens have a higher vesting than the rest of the allocations; 10% TGE and then 5% per month. Then, we have a 18-month vesting, as we are firmly belivers of the long-term of this initiative. Additionally, to ensure liquidity in pancake, we have proposed a mechanism that releases to the pool the same amount of tokens that are purchased in the marketplace by the users (NFT). As an example, when users buy 100,000 tokens in NFT, 100% of those tokens are burned to make the currency deflationary. To continue having a stable economy, what will be done is to release the same amount of tokens that are spent in NFT, from the team & advisors allocation, to put them in the Pancake pool and give liquidity. Basically what we are saying is that the team's tokens will have a long-term vesting, with a mechanism that provides liquidity based on the success of the game (purchase of NFT)
