# üåê Distribution

In this section, we explain how the tokens will be distributed among the community to dynamize the token economy, achieving the best possible distribution of the tokens (decentralizing) and fostering a sustainable initiative over time.

In the following table, we describe the different items in which we categorize the tokens to be issued, the percentage of tokens in each category, and the period of consolidation:



| Allocation              | %     | Vesting                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Seed Sale               | 1,0%  | 10% Released at TGE\*, then linear vesting over the next 12 months (7,5% per month)                                                                                |

| Public Sale             | 1,75% | 10% Released at TGE\*, then linear vesting over the next 12 months (7,5% per month). Liquidity pool locked at least 12 months to guarantee liquidity (PancakeSwap) |
| Marketing               | 5,0%  | 10% Released at TGE\*, then linear vesting over the next 12 months (7,5% per month)                                                                                |
| Donations               | 3,0%  | Unlock over 12 months                                                                                                                                              |
| Ecosystem\*\* & Listing | 5,0%  | \*\*(5% at TGE, then linear vesting over the next 12 months, only for ecosystem)                                                                                   |
| Play to Earn Rewards    | 65,0% | 66% at TGE, then the rest when farming mode is over                                                                                                                |
| Team & Advisors         | 17,5% | 10% at TGE, rest blocked until NFT are bought for by users. It will be unlocked periodically                                                                       |

To drive the token's value stability, the following mechanisms will be implemented:

### Liquidity

Periodically, tokens will be sent to Pancakeswap's LP (Liquidity pool) to maintain price stability. The same amount of tokens burned when users buy assets (NFT) will be sent to the LP.

### Burn

The tokens that users use to buy assets in the system (NFTs) will be sent to a wallet (0x0000) for burning. This will cause deflation, as there will be fewer and fewer tokens in the system and thus potentially increase their scarcity and value.

### Total Supply

A maximum of 320 million tokens will be created. Therefore, due to their scarcity, the value of the token is expected to raise in line with the market demand.
