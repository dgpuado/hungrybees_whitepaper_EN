# üåê Distribution

In this section, we explain how the tokens will be distributed among the community to dynamize the token economy, achieving the best possible distribution of the tokens (decentralizing) and fostering a sustainable initiative over time.

In the following table, we describe the different items in which we categorize the tokens to be issued, the percentage of tokens in each category, and the period of consolidation:



| Allocation           | %     | Vesting                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Seed Pre-Sale        | 1,0%  | 10% Released at TGE\*, then linear vesting over the next 12 months (7,5% per month)            |

To drive the token's value stability, the following mechanisms will be implemented:

### Liquidity

Periodically, tokens will be sent to Pancakeswap's LP (Liquidity pool) to maintain price stability. The same amount of tokens burned when users buy assets (NFT) will be sent to the LP. This liquidity pool will be kept over the time to provide stability.

### Burn

A 25% of the tokens that users use to buy assets in the system (NFTs) will be sent to a wallet (0x0000) for burning. This will cause deflation, as there will be fewer and fewer tokens in the system and thus potentially increase their scarcity and value.

### Total Supply

A maximum of 320 million tokens will be created. Therefore, due to their scarcity, the value of the token is expected to raise in line with the market demand.

### Team

Team's tokens have a higher vesting than the rest of the allocations; 1% at TGE and then 1% the first 3 months. Then, the rest of the tokens will be released over 24 months.&#x20;

### Play to Earn Rewards

On top of that, to guarantee the future of this initiative, tokens used by users to buy NFT items at HungryBees will be used to improve economy and sustainability of the ecosystem, following next split:&#x20;

* 25% - This percentage will be burnt, sending these tokens to a wallet 0x0000, to make our token deflationary.
* 25% - It will be stored in a Reserve allocation, to make a stable economy. Mainly, it will be used to add liquidity to the pool.
* 50% - It will be sent to Play To Earn Rewards, to allow us to keep rewarding our users at HungryBees or the next initiatives.
