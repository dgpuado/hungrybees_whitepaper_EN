# ðŸ“ˆ Tokenomics

With the goal of building a sustainable and stable long-term community, the #HBEE token (BEP-20) will be created, which will be implemented in the Binance Smart Chain and will extend the ERC-20 standard. Through the mechanisms listed below, we will seek to create a token that will maintain price stability, constant deflation, token "burn", and the existence of rewards of in-game NFTs holders.

The main utilities of the token are, on the one hand, the exchange of NFT services and assets within the metaverse (HungryBees - Play to earn) and, on the other hand, using it as an incentive for awareness and socially responsible actions in the real world.

Hungrybees will follow a dual token model (#HBEE and #HHON) to reduce transaction costs on the blockchain, facilitate the reward and payment system, and ensure sustainable growth in the #HBEE token price.&#x20;

The secondary #HHON token will trend a ratio of 1:100, where 1 #HBEE = 100 #HHON.
