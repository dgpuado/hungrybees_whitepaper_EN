# ðŸ“œ Audit Report

To accomplish the initial planning agreed between the government team of the initiative, it has been decided to make two different audits of our ecosystem. The purpose is to validate that the statements contained in this document are endorsed in the Smart Contracts of our token. For this reason, an audit of our #HBEE tokenÂ´s contract will be carried out with the TokenGuard company in the first instance. Later, an extended audit of both the token contract and the NFTs contract will be executed through Certik company.

### What is TokenGuard?

TokenGuard is a company dedicated to auditing and evaluating projects and initiatives within Ethereum and other blockchains. They use various techniques and sophisticated tools to detect errors in the code, avoiding any risk in tokens or Smart Contracts.
