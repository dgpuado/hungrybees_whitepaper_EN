# ðŸ“œ Audit Report

To accomplish the initial planning agreed between the government team of the initiative, it has been decided to make two different audits of our ecosystem. The purpose is to validate that the statements contained in this document are endorsed in the Smart Contracts of our token. For this reason, an audit of our #HBEE tokenÂ´s contract will be carried out with the TokenGuard company in the first instance. Later, an extended audit of both the token contract and the NFTs contract will be executed.



### Results of the audit

We have been awarded with a 10 score in TokenGuard audit
