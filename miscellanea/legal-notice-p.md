# ðŸ›ƒ Legal notice p

* This document hereafter referred to as Whitepaper, has been prepared to introduce the HungryBees project to potential participants and those interested in contributing to its development and expansion. This document does not imply any contractual relationship and, although the team has made a great effort detailing the initiative, the information may not be exhaustive in some points. The document should not be considered as a leaflet or application, nor should it be construed in any way as an offer to purchase values in any jurisdiction. It has not been drafted pursuant to any law or regulation of any jurisdiction intended to protect interested parties.

The jurisdiction applicable to those who decide to collaborate with the project will be that established in the Spanish territory, and HungryBees will not be responsible for the regulations of the country of origin of the interested party. The information contained in this document is merely descriptive, non-binding, and does not form part of the terms and conditions for the generation of HungryBees. Particularly, you should be aware that your participation in HungryBees may involve high risks and you may be asked to provide personal information or/and information about the origin of the funds received.

The HungryBees governance team will monitor the performance of the initiative and adjust those parameters of the system that allow for the long-term sustainability of the community.

All phases of HBEE sales will strictly follow the necessary KYC and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) process as well as money laundering prevention. Participants' personal information and proof of identity will be checked before HBEE tokens are sent to personal wallets.

HBEE tokens do not represent shares in the company and do not confer any rights to revenue sharing or voting rights.

Due to the lack of regulation in the cryptocurrency market, we have decided to join the Blockchain Arbitration Society (BAS - https://theblockchainarbitration.com). BAS is a private law association, legally constituted and formed by members of the legal, technological, and crypto community, in order to resolve internal conflicts within the crypto world. In other words, a legal environment that respects, promotes, and resolves crypto issues from the inside. By belonging to this association, we provide extra security to the community in a legal and secure framework, through a specialized Arbitration Court, which has already resolved other conflicts in the field of crypto investment.

### Taxes

The game economy is based on an internal currency (#HHON), which has no value outside the platform, so no tax is applied to users who hold this currency. However, if one of the users decides to sell their HBEE tokens and receive fiat currency, the user may be subject to duty or taxes depending on his/her place of residence. HungryBees is not responsible for any problem or tax claim arising from the transfer of the HBEE token in the secondary market
