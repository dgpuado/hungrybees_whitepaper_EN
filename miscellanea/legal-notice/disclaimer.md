### Risks Related with cryptocurrency and HBEE tokens

#### Мarket stagnation

&#x20;**** Because the public trade of **** HBEE tokens haven't started yet, their sale might not be active and the market might not be liquid. This might increase the volatility of token prices.

&#x20;Despite the existence of working products that facilitate the sale of HBEE tokens and their exchange for other cryptocurrencies, an efficient and effective public market for HBEE tokens can stagnate. Furthermore, if the development of the market of liquid HBEE tokens has stagnated, their price may show large volatility, as well as HBEE token holders can experience problems with liquidity at some moment.

&#x20;

#### Increase or decrease in cryptocurrency prices as a result of speculative trading risks

Evaluation of cryptocurrency on the collateral or secondary market is usually non-transparent and highly speculative. HBEE tokens do not provide their owner any rights to own the company's assets. HBEE tokens are not provided by any material values.

The HBEE token price can volatile significantly over a short period. There is an extreme risk that the HBEE token holder may lose the funds paid for the HBEE tokens. The worst scenario is when their value drops to zero.

&#x20;

#### HBEE token can have a zero market price

&#x20;**** There are no predictions or guarantees relative to the movement of liquidity of HBEE tokens. **** Hungry Bees is not responsible for the future market value of HBEE tokens, their liquidity, the speed of transfer and the possibility of entering various markets.

#### HBEE token can not be redeemed

Beside the cases provided by the applicable law or legally mandatory documentation, Hungry Bees is not responsible for the redemption of HBEE tokens and the return of funds to their owners.

There is no guarantee, and there will be no guarantee in the future, that HBEE token is valuable and useful. No promises can be given regarding the value of HBEE token.

The  return  of  the  funds paid for HBEE tokens can be infeasible in cases when an appeal is made to a version of the laws and regulations different from the acceptable on the Hungry Bees platform.

&#x20;

#### Holding HBEE tokens

The custody of the cryptocurrencies or Tokens to be issued is not carried out by an entity authorized to provide investment services.

The IEOs, as well as the custody of cryptocurrencies or Tokens, are based on what is known as distributed ledger technology or blockchain, a novel technology and not without risks, as described below.

#### Risks Associated with Blockchain technology and Software

#### Technical risks

The investment through Hungry Bees is aimed at financing a DAO platform which is still in the testing phase and may undergo modifications.

Investors are advised that the functionalities of the future Hungry Bees platform described in this Whitepaper are subject to change due to technical limitations.

#### Risk of government intervention

Hungry Bees is working in a new field of activity, which can be largely controlled and monitored by various agencies, including increased attention of law enforcement and investigation agencies. There is no guarantee that regulators will not undertake a detailed analysis of the activity done by Hungry Bees.

&#x20;

There is also no guarantee that legal action will not be taken against Hungry Bees. These actions may include various penalties, fines, disapprovals, reprimands and other punitive measures against Hungry Bees. Such retaliation may require Hungry Bees to reorganize its operations or reduce its offer of specific products and services. This can affect the Hungry Bees’s reputation and lead to higher operating costs, which will negatively affect the HBEE tokens and Hungry Bees ecosystem.

&#x20;

Legal risks

&#x20;

The legal status of cryptocurrency, tokens, blockchain technology and digital assets in many jurisdictions is not defined and uncleared.

&#x20;

It is difficult to predict which public authorities will regulate such technologies. It is difficult to predict the likely changes and amendments to the laws governing this in general, and also the applications with the blockchain technology, cryptographic tokens and digital assets. These changes can have a pessimistic effect on HBEE tokens. HBEE tokens can be considered as financial instruments that require the registration. Hungry Bees can stop the distribution of HBEE tokens, transactions in specific areas of jurisdiction, platform development and regional operations if such activities are deemed illegal and economically impractical for these reasons.

&#x20;

There is currently no specific legislation in Spain or the European Union that specifically regulates:

H       (i) the processes of initial issuance of cryptocurrency or IEO or,

H       (ii) the legal nature of the rights derived from the subscription, ownership or possession of cryptocurrencies or tokens.

&#x20;

In this sense, we refer to the recommendation of the “Bank of Spain” of February 8, 2018\[1] regarding "Unregulated space"\[2] where it states that if a person buys or holds "cryptocurrencies" they do not benefit from the guarantees and safeguards associated with financial products regulated. Said report also refers to the risks that we indicate and that may be extended to this issue:

H       Problems derived from the cross-border nature of the phenomenon,

H       High risk of loss of invested capital,

H       Illiquidity problems and

H       Extreme volatility and inadequate information.

&#x20;

&#x20;

**Utility Tokens**

Tokens (as this term is defined below) are classified as "utility tokens". It means is not a "negotiable securities" for the purposes of the provisions of Royal Legislative Decree 4/2015, of October 23, by which approves the revised text of the Securities Market Law (hereinafter the “Securities Market Law”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, investors are warned that token holders will not hold any of the rights that are normally associated with the holding of representative shares of the capital stock of commercial companies (such as, with an indicative but not limiting nature, right to vote or dividends), with respect to the issuer of HBEE described in this Whitepaper. The holders of Tokens will have the right to use the same for the use of HBEE. In this sense, in addition, report from the CNMV and Banc of Spain.

&#x20;

&#x20;

Inability to Maintain and Receive Licenses and Permissions

&#x20;

Since the date of the sale of HBEE tokens, there are no rules that require the company to receive the permissions and licenses necessary for this type of activity. There is a risk that such requirements can be introduced in future and will affect Hungry Bees.

&#x20;

In this case the business of Hungry Bees will be based on the urgency of these licenses and permissions and compliance with the relevant conditions on behalf of Hungry Bees. The terms of receiving and renewal of licenses, as well as control over the licensee's compliance with these licenses by regulatory authorities may differ.

&#x20;

These agencies may require Hungry Bees  to comply the following conditions: conditions of employment of qualified personnel; multiple standards; conditions of maintaining a certain technical level; consent to give permission to monitor our operations; standards of the system of quality control; level of service related requests; provision of relevant information at the request of licensing agencies. The realization of  these requirements may result in financial contributions and significant time, as well as delays in the operation of the Hungry Bees system. In addition, public and private persons have the right to comment on Hungry Bees and participate in the licensing process in other ways, including court  appeals and political pressure. Hungry Bees can not extend or does not receive the required licenses.

&#x20;

In addition, these licenses can limit the ability of Hungry Bees to perform its work on a commercial basis or to carry out its activities.

Onerous contract risk due to the compliance with regulations, lows and standards

&#x20;

Hungry Bees may not satisfy the applicable laws and regulations. It may also not recognize the results of relevant audits done by regulators. Another scenario is an increase of government regulation of operations done by Hungry Bees. All of these issues can entail the significant additional costs, simply complicating the work or leading to numerous sanctions. Result is a negative impact on the business of Hungry Bees.

&#x20;

The property and activities of Hungry Bees are guided by various government agencies and authorities to comply with the applicable rules and regulations. These regulators have considerable freedom and power in law  questions and their explanation. State agencies have the right to carry out the periodic inspections to monitor the property and activities of Hungry Bees. Any such audit may conclude that Hungry Bees violates certain regulations or rules, laws. Hungry Bees may not correct the violations or be unable to appeal those conclusions.

&#x20;

Any mistake made by Hungry Bees in  the field of compliance with the applicable regulations, laws or results of supervision may result in penalties, fines or more drastic requirements and sanctions. They may include the need to stop certain activities; they may even contain criminal and administrative charges against the  relevant  persons.

&#x20;

Such decisions, sanctions, demands and tighter control of government regulation can increase the costs of Hungry Bees and have a very detrimental impact on its platform and its business as a whole.
