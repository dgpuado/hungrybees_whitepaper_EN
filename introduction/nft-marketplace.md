These three representations correspond to NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) which have been sold for $69.3 million, $11.8 million, and $6 million respectively. It seems unbelievable, but this is real, and it is happening due to blockchain technology, smart contracts, and NFTs.&#x20;

NFTs are digital assets that represent an object, either physical or virtual, that allows you to certify that an asset is unique in its type and characteristics. Examples of these assets are artwork, collectible items, or in-game assets (in-game items).&#x20;

Interest in this type of digital assets (NFTs) has grown steadily over the last 4 years, since 2017, but it has been in this year 2021 when it has had an exponential growth. This growth is mainly derived from the adoption of NFTs in the online gaming sector, through the trading of in-game assets where such interest has come to develop a certain level of maturity. Recently, other industries, like music or art worlds, have been experimenting with this technology.

In Hungry Bees we are going to develop an NFT marketplace to allow users and players to mint, sell, collect and exchange Play-to-Earn game assets, items and rarities. All these assets will be obtained by doing in-game tasks, as we will explain in the next section.
