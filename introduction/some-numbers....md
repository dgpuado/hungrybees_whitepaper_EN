## G**reen shoots**?

We consider our initiative is based on three different levers that makes us totally different in the market:

#### ESG (Environmental, Social & Governance)

One of the key trends we are seeing in the market is a huge focus on promoting sustainable developments, looking for satisfying current needs without comprising our future, getting the balance between economical growth, respect to our planet and social welfare. ESG market is huge and both, private banking and big asset management are supporting sustainable investment.

#### Gaming

Gaming has played a critical role in society in the entertainment industry, currently accelerated by the pandemic. The virtual world has promoted social interactivity and competitiveness among users, increasingly creating a lifestyle based on video games. The growth in the gaming market is brutal, with 10% growth rates per year.

From our initiative, we try to change the traditional business model where the users had to pay for play. In our model, we will pay users for play our games.

#### NFT Marketplace

Last but not least, we are experiencing an explosion in the cryptocurrencies and digital assets domain, a trend that will not stop growing in the coming years.

{% hint style="info" %}
Non-fungible token (NFT) market capitalization has shown accelerated growth in recent years, almost multiplying its value ten times in two years. However, it is still far from reaching the relevance enjoyed by cryptocurrencies
