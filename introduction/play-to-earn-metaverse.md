# ðŸŽ® Play-to-Earn Metaverse

Nearly three million people in the world are electronic game players, with the global market estimated to be worth more than $175 billion by 2021, according to a recent study published by newzoo.

Both developers and players are the main sources of value in that market, but so far no best way has been found for players to monetize that value. At that point is where the Play-to-Earn business model comes into play, on which our initiative is based. It is a model under the concept of an open economy that provides benefits to those players who add value to the community through their participation in the game.&#x20;

Hungry Bees allows users to collect crypto-tokens and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) which can be sold in the market and will be acquired through the game and the collaboration of players with the different sustainability actions mentioned in this document. Our vision is the evolution of these Play-to-Earn models towards the creation of a metaverse where players are given full control of their digital assets and exchange tokens and NFTs across the ecosystem, providing a unique gaming experience.&#x20;

On one hand, our dream is to be able to influence the real-life actions of our users throughout the virtual world and sustainable and rewardable actions in the metaverse. On the other hand, we would like to impact the virtual world (metaverse) through real-life actions, rewarding beneficial behaviors to the planet and society with tokens and NFTs, and recognizing the value of players.&#x20;

This metaverse will allow merging both real and virtual worlds, being able to extract benefits from each one
