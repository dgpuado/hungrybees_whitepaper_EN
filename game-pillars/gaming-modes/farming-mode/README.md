# ðŸ‘¨ðŸŒ¾ Farming mode

HungryBees Farming mode is just one of the game modes that make up our universe. Through it, users will put themselves in the shoes of a beekeeper in an apocalyptic world in which the game is set. In this mode, players have their hive and bees and they are responsible for taking care of it in order to fulfill this adventure while getting rewards for playing. They also will be able to buy bees and hives (NFT) in the in-game store (until they run out) or directly buy them from another player in the marketplace.

Beekeepers must protect their hives and bees from unpredictable weather and countless events that can increase or decrease their hive's honey production. From magnetic fields to bear-killing plasma cannons, beekeepers will have a bunch of items at their disposal to protect their possessions and maximize their honey production. A limited number of bees and hives will be available to ensure game stability and scarcity.

### Farming Characteristics

In order to keep the usual honey production, each bee must be fed with 1 unit of lithium supplement and 2 units of liquid hydrogen every 12 hours. In the case that it is not done, the honey production of that bee will be stopped and the production will be lost until the beekeeper feeds it.

On the other hand, seasons of the year will play a major role in the production of the hives. Exactly as it happens in real life, production will be higher in the seasons with better weather for the bees. In the world of HungryBees, seasons are 4 days long, so approximately one month in real life is equivalent to 2 years for our bees.

Spring is the season that will generate the most bonuses for beekeepers, as it is the peak time in the annual development of the hives. The production of the bees will increase by 40% compared to their normal production. In the same way, there is also a unique feature for this season generating an extra 50% bonus in garden pollination during spring. Summer will also generate a 5% increase in production. However, autumn and winter will penalize the productivity of your bees by 20% and 35% respectively.&#x20;

In addition, different events could appear during each season of the year generating their own unique disturbances in the hive and honey production. Beekeepers will be able to eliminate the effects of the events through specific items that can be found in the in-game store. It is also possible that there may be no event at all.
