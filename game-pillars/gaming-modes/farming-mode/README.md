# ðŸ‘¨ðŸŒ¾ Farming mode

HungryBees Farming mode is just one of the game modes that make up our universe. Through it, users will put themselves in the shoes of a beekeeper in an apocalyptic world in which the game is set. In this mode, players have their hive and bees and they are responsible for taking care of it in order to fulfill this adventure while getting rewards for playing. They also will be able to buy bees and hives (NFT) in the in-game store (until they run out) or directly buy them from another player in the marketplace.

Beekeepers must protect their hives and bees from unpredictable weather and countless events that can increase or decrease their hive's honey production. From magnetic fields to bear-killing plasma cannons, beekeepers will have a bunch of items at their disposal to protect their possessions and maximize their honey production. A limited number of bees and hives will be available to ensure game stability and scarcity.

### Farming Characteristics

In order to keep the usual honey production, each bee must be fed with 1 unit of lithium supplement and 2 units of liquid hydrogen every 12 hours. In the case that it is not done, the honey production of that bee will be stopped and the production will be lost until the beekeeper feeds it.

On the other hand, seasons of the year will play a major role in the production of the hives. Exactly as it happens in real life, production will be higher in the seasons with better weather for the bees. In the world of HungryBees, seasons are 4 days long, so approximately one month in real life is equivalent to 2 years for our bees.

Spring is the season that will generate the most bonuses for beekeepers, as it is the peak time in the annual development of the hives. The production of the bees will increase by 40% compared to their normal production. In the same way, there is also a unique feature for this season generating an extra 50% bonus in garden pollination during spring. Summer will also generate a 5% increase in production. However, autumn and winter will penalize the productivity of your bees by 20% and 35% respectively.&#x20;

In addition, different events could appear during each season of the year generating their own unique disturbances in the hive and honey production. Beekeepers will be able to eliminate the effects of the events through specific items that can be found in the in-game store. It is also possible that there may be no event at all.

### Gardens

Gardens are places where you can grow plants of different types that bees will have to pollinate to get honey of different flavors. This honey will temporarily increase the qualities of the bees and can be used in combat game modes to gain advantages over your opponents. Gardens, unlike hives and bees, will NOT be NFTs but will be items that can be purchased in the in-game shop. Each garden will have space to grow 5 plants at the same time.&#x20;

### Plants

The plants can be grown in the gardens to obtain honeys of different flavors. You can find 5 different types of plants depending on their characteristics, the mineral and, therefore, the honey they produce, as well as the quality of the bee that they temporarily improve.

| Plant       | Honey          |          |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Lithiumine  | Lithium Honey  | Movement |
| Brominilite | Bromine Honey  | Range    |
| Yttriumist  | Yttrium Honey  | Speed    |
| Leadine     | Lead Honey     | Attack   |
| Titaniumile | Titanium Honey | Defense  |

To get honey, bees must pollinate the plants daily. Each bee will have a counter with the number of times it can pollinate every 24 hours. When it reaches it, it will not be able to pollinate again until the next 24 hours. Like bees, plants will have a counter that will measure the number of times they have been pollinated. When the counter reaches 200, the player can claim their pot of Honey Boosters. The cost of sending a bee to pollinate a plant is 1 HHON.

### Honey Boosters

Each of the plants will help to generate honey with a specific flavor. Honey will be produced by pollinating the plant 200 times and will serve to enhance the abilities of the bees. Depending on the plant, the following types of honey can be obtained:

| Honey          | Boost                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Lithium Honey  | +1 movement of the bee |
| Bromine Honey  | +1 range of the bee    |
| Yttrium Honey  | +1 speed of the bee    |
| Lead Honey     | +10 attack of the bee  |
| Titanium Honey | +15 defense of the bee |

These different jars of honey can be used in combat mode to improve the bees' abilities. There will be a limit to the use of enhancing honey since only a maximum of 3 kinds of honey can be used per bee every 12 hours.

### Technology Trees

Within the farming mode, there will be the possibility of obtaining permanent benefits due to the investigation of new arts and sciences through technology trees. There will be two technology trees depending on the modalities to be investigated:

Military path: by researching these technologies, beekeepers will have permanent advantages in the combat game mode (boost in the qualities of the bees in their hive).

Scientific path: these technologies will allow beekeepers to obtain advantages in the farming mode (lower costs of honey production, protections against adverse weather, etc).

All of these arts and sciences will have an opportunity cost, as some research time will be required before unlocking more innovative technologies. In addition, unlocking them will have a certain cost in HBEE, since the investigators will have to have a budget to be able to achieve the objectives.
