# üçØ Honey Boosters

### Honey Boosters

Each of the plants will help to generate honey with a specific flavor. Honey will be produced by pollinating the plant 200 times and will serve to enhance the abilities of the bees. Depending on the plant, the following types of honey can be obtained:

| Honey          | Boost                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Lithium Honey  | +1 movement of the bee |
| Bromine Honey  | +1 range of the bee    |
| Yttrium Honey  | +1 speed of the bee    |
| Lead Honey     | +10 attack of the bee  |
| Titanium Honey | +15 defense of the bee |

These different jars of honey can be used in combat mode to improve the bees' abilities. There will be a limit to the use of enhancing honey since only a maximum of 3 kinds of honey can be used per bee every 12 hours.
