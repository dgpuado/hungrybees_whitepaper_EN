# üè° Gardens and plants

### Gardens

Gardens are places where you can grow plants of different types that bees will have to pollinate to get honey of different flavors. This honey will temporarily increase the qualities of the bees and can be used in combat game modes to gain advantages over your opponents. Gardens, unlike hives and bees, will NOT be NFTs but will be items that can be purchased in the in-game shop. Each garden will have space to grow 5 plants at the same time.&#x20;

### Plants

The plants can be grown in the gardens to obtain honey of different flavors. You can find 5 different types of plants depending on their characteristics, the mineral and, therefore, the honey they produce, as well as the quality of the bee that they temporarily improve. The price of the plants will be 75 HHON.

| Plant       | Honey          |          |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Lithiumine  | Lithium Honey  | Movement |
| Brominilite | Bromine Honey  | Range    |
| Yttriumist  | Yttrium Honey  | Speed    |
| Leadine     | Lead Honey     | Attack   |
| Titaniumile | Titanium Honey | Defense  |

To get honey, bees must pollinate the plants daily. Each bee will have a counter with the number of times it can pollinate every 24 hours. When it reaches it, it will not be able to pollinate again until the next 24 hours. Like bees, plants will have a counter that will measure the number of times they have been pollinated. When the counter reaches 200, the player can claim their pot of Honey Boosters. The cost of sending a bee to pollinate a plant is 1 HHON.
