### Technology Trees

Within the farming mode, there will be the possibility of obtaining permanent benefits due to the investigation of new arts and sciences through technology trees. There will be two technology trees depending on the modalities to be investigated:

Military path: by researching these technologies, beekeepers will have permanent advantages in the combat game mode (boost in the qualities of the bees in their hive).

Scientific path: these technologies will allow beekeepers to obtain advantages in the farming mode (lower costs of honey production, protections against adverse weather, etc).

All of these arts and sciences will have an opportunity cost, as some research time will be required before unlocking more innovative technologies. In addition, unlocking them will have a certain cost in HBEE, since the investigators will have to have a budget to be able to achieve the objectives.
