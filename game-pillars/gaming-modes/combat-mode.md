# ðŸ‘Š Combat mode

In the different fighting modes, beekeepers will use their bees to fight against different enemies or against other beekeepers. For this game mode, the bees have certain abilities that will limit their fighting power:&#x20;

* Attack: a characteristic that measures the amount of damage a bee inflicts on another bee.
* Defense: A bee's ability to receive attacks and withstand damage.
* Movement: A statistic that indicates the length a bee can travel each turn.&#x20;
* Range: An indicator denoting the distance a bee can attack its opponent through.
* Speed: This statistic determines the order of the bees' turns. The faster the bee, the earlier its turn will be.

Based on these statistics, players must design their strategy to defeat their opponents before they kill their bees. To increase these stats, beekeepers will be able to get different boosters in the farming game mode through pollination. Each combat game mode has its little distinctions and quirks.&#x20;

#### Adventure Mode

In this mode, bees will fight different types of enemies. To perform these fights, you will have to spend energy. However, defeating the enemy will earn rewards in HHON tokens.

#### PVP Mode

Beekeepers will fight each other with their bees in 4vs4 games. In this mode, players will pay tokens (the number of tokens paid will vary depending on different variables) and the winner will get tokens (#HHON). This game mode will not require any energy expenditure, you can play as many times as you want.&#x20;

#### Other game modes

Other modes will be added based on competitions, clans, alliances, allowing beekeepers to obtain tokens in epic fights against very powerful enemies. To perform these fights, you will have to spend energy and you will get rewards in the HHON token. We will consider the different proposals that players can make in order to develop other game modes when the time comes out.&#x20;
