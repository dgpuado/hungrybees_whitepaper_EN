# ðŸ‘‘ Queen Bee

Although a beekeeper may have more than one queen bee, only one queen bee may be added to each hive at a time. Due to their exclusivity, their honey-producing power as well as their fighting abilities are superior to those of other types of bees.

The queen will be the only type of bee that will be able to raise new bees without limit, unlike drones, whose brood limit is 1.

It is the most difficult bee to find, with a 10% probability of appearance.

Attached below are tables showing the ability and production ranges of queen bees according to their rarity.
