# 🐝 Bees

Bees are the main asset of the game, indispensable for generating honey and carrying out actions such as pollinating gardens or producing boosting honey. As a fundamental basis, the goal is to keep them as scarce assets, which will increase their value and help to maintain the HungryBees economy. In this way, the maximum number of bees available in the metaverse will be 300,000 bees, allowing for further limited breeding in a second phase.

Inside the game, three different types of bees will be available to beekeepers, with their unique characteristics and special abilities within the hive. The rarity of these bees will determine the amount of honey each will be able to generate for the hive.

* Queen Bee
* Drone Bee
* Worker Bee
