# 游녿 Drone Bee

Like queens, drones are the other type of bee that can breed, although, unlike them, each drone can only breed once (only first-generation bees can breed, bees born through the breeding method will not be able to breed again). In this way, the number of bees is limited, making them a valuable and scarce resource.

The bees will have a 30% chance of being drones.

The following table shows the minimum and maximum ranges of the production that drones will generate, as well as their fighting abilities.
