# ðŸŽ€ Breeding

In order to breed the second-generation bees, it will be a prerequisite that the parent bees have not exceeded their set brood limit. In addition, a fee of 60 HBEE will be charged as part of the rearing process. &#x20;

Once the breeding process starts, a larva will be generated which will need to complete a 1-day incubation process until its hatching and the new bee appearance. At this moment, the new bee will become fully operational for the beekeeper.

To keep limited the number of bees since the beginning making them a scarce and valuable commodity, the number of offspring that can be generated by the first-generation bees will be also limited. Thus, there will be a maximum number of 90,000 (one per first-generation drone bee) new bees born through breeding in this second phase.
