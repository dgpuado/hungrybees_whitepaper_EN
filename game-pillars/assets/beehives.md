# ðŸŒ³ Beehives

On the other hand, beekeepers will also have the possibility of acquiring hives to take care of their bees. In this case, hives are divided into three types depending on their rarity. Its rarity will determine the number of bees that can be kept inside of the hives. It should be noted that each beekeeper will be given a free hive with 3 empty slots for bees. The maximum number of queen bees per hive will be 1, and it should be placed in the central slot of the hive.

Each beekeeper will be able to own a maximum of 5 hives at the same time, being able to use only one of them to generate the production of his bees.

#### Free

It is able to contain a maximum of 3 bees. The central slot is reserved for a queen bee, if available, but cannot be occupied by any other type of bee.

#### Basic

With 7 slots to place bees, they will be the most frequent hives with a 60% probability of appearance.

#### Rare

They will have slots to keep 13 bees inside them. The hivesÂ´ probability of being a rare hive will be 30%.

#### Epic

Epic hives will be the best hives a beekeeper can get. They are valuable because of their ability to hold 19 bees. Only 10% of the hives will be epic.

**Full hive bonus**

In addition to the individual production of each bee, hives will give a bonus to the beekeeper if all their slots are fulfilled by a bee. Therefore, the honey production of the entire hive will increase by 1% (for basic hives), 3% (for rare hives), and 5% (for epic hives) when each of the hive slots has been filled and are generating honey (#HHON).
