# ðŸ’¥ Assets

In HungryBees, the main assets of the game are the hives (NFT) and the bees (NFT), but there are other factors that will have a direct impact on the game (weather, gardens, flowers, bears, honey...). Hives will be the place where the bees will work to generate honey (#HHON). On the other hand, bees are the main asset to generate honey and take part in different activities that will be carried out within the HungryBees metaverse.

The different types of assets that may be acquired are detailed below:

* Bees
* Beehives
* Items
