# ðŸ’¢ Rarities

One of the most important elements of NFTs is their rarity. Both bees and hives will be divided into rarities, which will determine the honey production range and their fighting abilities (in the case of bees) and the ability to keep bees (beehive).   &#x20;

The rarity of the bees will determine the amount of honey (#HHON) you get with each of them, as well as several skills and abilities for the fight. These bees will be divided into 4 different rarity levels (Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary). The higher the rarity, the less likely they are to appear, thus ensuring the best distribution of them and the sustainability of the game.&#x20;

The bees will be divided into the different rarities with the following frequency:&#x20;



| Raritie   | Appearance Percentage |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Common    | 60%                   |
| Rare      | 25%                   |
| Epic      | 13%                   |
| Legendary | 2%                    |
