When taking care of their hives, beekeepers will face different situations and events that can compromise the well-being of their bees and honey production. To do so, they will be able to acquire elements to counteract the harmful effects of these events. While some of them only appear in one of the seasons, other events appear with different frequencies in the different seasons of the year.

We break down the events by season in order to shed some light on the consequences of each one:
