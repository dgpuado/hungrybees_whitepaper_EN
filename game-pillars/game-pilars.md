As mentioned above, we have chosen the Play-to-Earn model for our game. That decision was made because it adopts the concept of an open economy and makes it easy for all players to achieve financial benefits. Players will own their in-game assets and will have the possibility to earn profit and increase the value of those assets by participating in the different game modes. At the same time, they will generate value for the rest of the players and the ecosystem.

Our main goal is to make Hungry Bees a reference into the crypto world while we try to raise awareness among our users in making sustainable decisions in the real world through a fun game that rewards them in a sustainable way over time. We desire to merge real and virtual worlds so that actions taken in one of them have a positive impact on the other one.

## Game topic

The game is inspired by a dystopian world where, due to pollution and exploitation of the Earth in the past, there has been a great extinction of flora and fauna all over the planet. In this scenario, bees are not the exception, being strongly affected, drastically decreasing the number of specimens, and threatening the future of the planet.

It is well known, bees are the main pollinating agent of plants, being the ones that make it possible for them to reproduce and expand from all over the world. In the case that the number of bees decreases, the reproductive capacity of plants will be drastically reduced and, therefore, the viability of life on Earth. In this scenario, a group of environmentally conscious scientists and beekeepers devised a strategy to save the planet through the hybridization of bees with nano-robots, ensuring the pollination of the Earth.

This is how the Hungry Bees were born. These robotic bees have the mission of reforesting the planet and making the Earth the home of millions of species, returning it to its former magnificence. However, bees are not totally autonomous, as they need to be taken care of (feeding them, helping them to collect honey, etc). Scientists have already done all they could. Now it is time for ALL of us to get down to work and make the miracle happen to save the planet. We are already focused on the tasks. What are you waiting for to help us?

Hungry Bees is divided into several phases. In the first phase (farming), beekeepers will get their hives and bees. They will need to protect these assets from weather events that could be averse in order to carry out the task of reforestation and honey production (HHON). In the second phase, once the first pollination objective has been achieved, problems will appear. Beekeepers will have to fight against unexpected opponents that will threaten the goal of restoring life on Earth.
